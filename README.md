# HaloMiniGame
Halo Mini Game in C# using Raylib for final project.

In this class I learned the principles of programming with classes. I learned about abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and maintainability.  I learned to apply these principles creating small games using the Raylib library in C#. This was my final project. A simple 2D game with Master Chief fighting Elites.
